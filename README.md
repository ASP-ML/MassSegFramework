# MassSeg-Framework: A Breast Mass Detection and Segmentation Framework Based on Deep Learning and Active Contour Model

## Project Objective:
Implement MassSeg, a new automatic two-step breast mass segmentation method that combines the YOLOv11 architecture with a Chan-Vesse active contour model to maximize the lesion’s detection and enhance the lesion’s segmentation on mammography images.

- MATLAB R2024 with these add-ons:
    - Image Processing Toolbox
    - MATLAB Coder
    - MATLAB Compiler
    - MATLAB SDK
    - MATLAB Test
 
### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ASP-ML/MassSeg.git
cd MassSeg
```

### MATLAB Setup
1. Install the MATLAB Add-On for Python Integration
    - Open MATLAB.
    - Click on Add-Ons, then on Get Add-Ons.
    - Search for "Using MATLAB with Python" and install the version provided by Sebastian Castro.
2. Set Up MATLAB Path
    - In MATLAB, click Set Path.
    - Click Add Folder, then add the path to the Pipeline Matlab folder (e.g., C:\Users\user\MassSeg\Pipeline\Matlab).
    - Select the newly added path, click Move to Top, then click Save.

### Setup Running Environment
1. Setup the Python Environment
    - In your IDE's terminal (e.g., Visual Studio Code), run the install_conda_PL.ps1 script.   
2. Install MATLAB Engine API for Python
    - Follow the official [MATLAB Engine API installation steps](https://la.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html)
        - Before doing the installation, navigate to the MATLAB installation directory using the terminal (Windows-Specific Command). Be sure to be in the C:\ folder: 
            ```bash
            $ cd '.\Program Files\MATLAB\R2024a'
            ```
        - Then, when installing, replace in the command "matlabroot" with "." (ex., below): 
            ```bash
            $ cd '.\extern\engines\python'
            ```
        - Install engine API version 24.1.2 (ensure the BCIenv environment is activated in your IDE's terminal before running the command): 
            ```bash
            $ python -m pip install matlabengine==24.1.2
            ```
